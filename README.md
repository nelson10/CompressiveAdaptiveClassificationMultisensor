# Adaptive coded aperture design for compressive multisensor spectral imaging
This repository aims to adaptive design the coded apertures from compressive spectral images acquired with a multisensor camera. The classification is performed using the captured compressive projections.

To run the code using either the function Main3DCASSI or MainCCASSI that perform the sensing, Adaptive coded aperture design and classification using the compressive measurements.

The datasets could be download from the following link:

The files should be placed in the Data folder of this repository.
